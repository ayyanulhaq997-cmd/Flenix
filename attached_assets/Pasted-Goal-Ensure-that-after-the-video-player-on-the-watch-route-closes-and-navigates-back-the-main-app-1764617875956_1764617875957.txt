Goal: Ensure that after the video player on the /watch route closes and navigates back, the main application view (/tv or /) renders correctly, allowing full user interaction and navigation.I. 1️⃣ Verify Data Consistency after ExitCheck Local Storage/Context: When the video player exits and calls the handleExit function, verify that the activeProfileId and the user's JWT token are still present in localStorage and haven't been accidentally cleared.Problem: If the token is cleared, the app thinks the user is logged out and displays a blank or error screen instead of the home page.Verify Progress Save Status: Ensure the API call to save viewing progress (POST /api/viewing-history) completes successfully before the navigation occurs. A failed API call might be throwing an unhandled exception that stops the rest of the application from rendering.II. 2️⃣ Enforce Focus Restoration LogicThe most common reason for a "blank" or "frozen" page after a player exits in a TV app is that the navigation system is waiting for an element to receive focus, but the element is not available or the focus logic is failing.Check TVHome.tsx Load: In your client/src/pages/tv-home.tsx component, add a temporary console.log("TVHome.tsx is loading!") inside the component body.If the log does not appear: The routing or authentication gate is still blocking access.If the log does appear: The component is loading, but the D-pad focus management code is failing.Fix Focus Loop: The focus restoration code that runs on the home page must handle two states:If a previous poster (contentId) is stored: Restore focus to that poster.If no poster is stored (e.g., first entry): Default focus must be set to the RESUMEN tab or the REPRODUCIR button on the Hero banner.III. 3️⃣ Prompt to the Agent"The application is failing to render the main interface after successfully exiting the video player on the /watch route. The screen appears blank or frozen because the component is not loading or is losing D-pad focus."Action Required:Confirm that the JWT token and active profile ID remain intact in the client-side storage after the player exit.In the TVHome.tsx component, review the initial focus logic. Ensure that if the app fails to restore focus to the last viewed poster, it implements a reliable fallback focus to a known element (like the RESUMEN tab) to ensure the UI is interactive upon return.Test the full sequence: /watch $\to$ Esc/Back $\to$ /tv. The home page must load and allow immediate D-pad navigation.
