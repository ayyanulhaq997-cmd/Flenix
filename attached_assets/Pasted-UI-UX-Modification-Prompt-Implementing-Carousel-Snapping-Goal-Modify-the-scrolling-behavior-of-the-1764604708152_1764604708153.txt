UI/UX Modification Prompt: Implementing Carousel Snapping
Goal: Modify the scrolling behavior of the content rows (built in TVContentRow.tsx) on the TV application to eliminate the standard horizontal scrollbar and implement a smooth, calculated Carousel Snapping effect, matching the premium Netflix viewing experience.

I. 🛑 Hide Manual Scroll Elements
Action: Modify the CSS for the content row container in TVContentRow.tsx to completely hide the horizontal scrollbar.

Requirement: Ensure the underlying scrolling functionality is not disabled, only the visual scrollbar itself.

II. ➡️ Implement Calculated Translation (Snap Behavior)
Action: Rewrite the logic that handles horizontal movement (triggered by the Left and Right remote keys).

Current Logic: Currently moves the row by a few pixels (pixel-by-pixel shift).

Desired Logic:

When the focused poster reaches a threshold position (e.g., the 4th visible poster), calculate the exact distance required to shift the entire row container.

Apply a smooth CSS transform: translateX() to move the container to align the next set of posters cleanly on the screen.

The movement must be fixed—not continuous—meaning the content snaps into the next viewing window.

III. ⚡ Update Fast-Scroll Logic
Action: Update the existing Fast-scroll logic (which accelerates the movement when a key is held down).

Desired Behavior: Holding the Left/Right key should trigger the calculated snap-shift function repeatedly and quickly, allowing the user to rapidly cycle through content windows without the visual stutter of accelerated pixel scrolling.

IV. State Management Checklist
Ensure the component accurately tracks the focusedIndex (the single poster with the red border).

Ensure the component tracks the containerOffset (the calculated translateX value) to manage the alignment of the currently focused poster within the viewport.

This ensures the scrolling logic is converted from a standard web scroll to a responsive, fixed-window TV app carousel.
